Pocket Wingman is my first foray into mobile app development. It's an iOS app written in Objective-C. I built it from scratch following an MVC design pattern.

The Model–view–controller (MVC) way of doing things was too abstract for me at first. Full admission here: I had been coding for a little over a year when I began the project, and although I had worked previously for a startup I hadn't yet worked as a full fledged front-end developer. My way of doing things was fly by the seat of your pants and I had virtually no object-oriented programming experience or work with data modeling before.

## So What Is A Model, A View, And A Controller

The way I began to understand MVC philosophy is that it's similar to website development -- you separate content from styles from functionality -- in how it separates project components. Here's a list of loose correlations to demonstrate what I mean:  

    MVC               Site Development

    Model        =    Database
    View         =    HTML/CSS
    Controller   =    JavaScript


## What I Learned


- Developing a GUI (graphical user interface) from square one
- Separating model (data), view (graphical representations of the data), and controller (user input/interaction) functionality
- Xcode SDK development tools and workflow
- Working/managing Apple Signing Certificates and Provisioning Profiles
- App publishing through iTunes Connect

Frankly, this is the first piece of software I'd ever written and as necessity is the mother of invention, it was spurred on by me wanting to learn app development and use technology to improve my life. When I first thought of this project I got the idea from watching people interacting THROUGH their phones with each other. I was struck by how people used them to connect with each other instead of ignoring each other. That's the core idea behind Pocket Wingman. How could I leverage my phone to break the ice with people? All you have to do is pass someone your phone and it does the work for you.

## Key Features


- A drawing game captures a user's input
- The accelerometer prompts user interaction to move forward through views
- The touch screen is used to continue progress through a variety of gestures
