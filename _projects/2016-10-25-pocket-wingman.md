Pocket Wingman is my first foray into mobile app development. It's an iOS app written in Objective-C.  I built it from scratch following an MVC design pattern.  

![My helpful screenshot](/images/MVC-Process.svg){: .float--right }Being a noob in the industry, the Model–view–controller (MVC) way of doing things was hard for me to pick up at first.  I hadn't spent much time working with object-oriented programming or data modeling before.  And I certainly couldn't wrap my head around exactly what was a model, what was a view, and what a controller was.

My solution to this problem, as is most often the case, get my hands dirty and find the patterns.  Before long I began to understand an MVC philosophy is similar to website development in that it separated project components.  In website development you separate content from styles from functionality just as in MVC design   And grasping this concept allowed me to organize my file structure 

is a software design pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.

Some key lessons I learned from this project are:


- Developing a GUI (graphical user interface) from square one
- Separating model (data), view (graphical representations of the data), and controller (user input/interaction) functionality
- Xcode SDK development tools and workflow
- Working/managing Apple Signing Certificates and Provisioning Profiles
- App publishing through iTunes Connect

Frankly, this is the first piece of software I'd ever written and as necessity is the mother of invention, it was spurred on by me wanting to meet women.  When I first thought of this project I got the idea from watching people interacting with their phones and through their phones with each other.  I was sitting in a restaurant when I noticed how folks were sharing pictures by passing their phones around.  I was struck by how these people were using them to connect with each other instead of ignoring each other.

So, I thought about how I could leverage my phone to break the ice with people I hadn't met before.  That's the core idea behind Pocket Wingman.  Most of us enjoy playing games on our phones and if you're somewhat of an introvert like me, interacting with a phone is lot lower key than starting a conversation with a stranger.  All you have to do is pass someone your phone and it does the work for you.

What's happening behind the scenes with this app really gets me going.  I learned so much about software engineering in general, iOS development specifically, and the powerful technology that is an Apple iPhone.  Pocket Wingman uses games built around the devices features and capabilities:


- A drawing game captures a user's input
- The accelerometer prompts user interaction to move forward through views
- The touch screen is used in a variety of ways to continue progress through screen manipulation
