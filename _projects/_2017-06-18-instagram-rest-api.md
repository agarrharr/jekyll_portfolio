The story goes like this.

## Customization

In order to make the most of this project it helps to know `Node.js`. Or, at least, knowing your way around node modules. Modules represent each of the core display outputs. A main `config.js` file provides a central place to customize these modules.

Here's a portion of that `config.js` file:

```javascript

```

The include should be directly below.
{% include instagram-api.html %}

As you can see, `config.js` is used primarily to tie together all the separate modules, position them in their appropriate places on screen, and offer basic customization options.

## The MVP

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}
