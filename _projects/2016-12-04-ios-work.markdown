This project is kind of a two-birds-one-stone kind of deal for me. First off, I'm bolstering my JavaScript chops by creating some pretty rad interactions for this page.

## Treehouse

I've got nothing but love for the folks at [Treehouse](https://treehouse.com). They helped me get my start and are the reason I'm in the industry in the first place.

AND they have a ton of technologies to study.

## iOS Development

Here are some mobile apps I built following instruction from Treehouse.

## Algorhythm

The first one I want to show you is Algorhythm. It's a list making app set to the task of creating playlists for different moods and activities. This is the first project I built using Xcode's auto layout capabilities.

## Blog Reader

Blog Reader does exactly like its name suggests, accesses a list of blogs via a JSON feed. This project is built on a Table View Controller.
