Fifteen hours of solo non-stop hiking on a twenty-two mile round trip from start to finish. Hiking in darkness through bear infested forest and known mountain lion territory. Over one mile of vertical feet from trailhead to summit. This project is one I'm most proud of.

At the edge of Sequoia National Park, standing 14,505 feet, Mt. Whitney is the tallest peak in the contiguous states. Interestingly enough, it's a little over 80 miles from the lowest point in North America at Badwater in Death Valley National Park, at 279 feet below sea level.

To climb, hike, or backpack in the Mt. Whitney Zone or on the Mt. Whitney Trail you must apply for a permit via the Mt. Whitney Lottery. Mt. Whitney, Mt. Whitney, Mt. Whitney. My first permit application was successful only to have my opportunity snowed out in mid-May 2014. It was likely a blessing as I had more time to train.

A month before I arrived a man fell to his death trying for the summit, so I came prepared. I arrived the evening before my ascent on September 10 with a full backpack; 5 liters of water and sport drinks; five pounds of food. I had a half dozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a pound of granola, among other high energy, easily digestible snacks with simple sugars. Of course, I had an entire box of chocolate chip Clif bars.

I had read it was best to begin early, before daybreak, and being unable to sleep I started at midnight. The trail was almost deserted at this time and I only occasionally saw the lights from headlamps further up the trail ahead of me. Probably being a huge mistake, it was a bright night so I turned off my headlamp and walked by moonlight. Later I'd read that it's a good idea NOT to sneak up on bears.  

I hiked past a few pristine alpine lakes and waterfalls. Betwixt 11,000 and 12,000 feet the trees grew shorter and stockier before ceasing to grow at all. It had become a lunar landscape by the time I reached the 99 Switchbacks. At the top of that feature I was at 13,300 feet, seven hours into my summit attempt, a little dehydrated and losing confidence. I won't lie, I cried a little. Here I was at the top of the mountain saddle and I honestly didn't think I could reach my goal. Up to this point I thought the saddle was a lot closer to the peak, so when I realized I had over a thousand more vertical feet to go I almost broke.

Figuring that foolish decisions make great stories, I pounded another 5 Hour Energy and soldiered on. I arrived at the peak at exactly 9 a.m. and for a moment I had the place to myself. It was otherworldly. At roughly 60% of the oxygen at sea level just catching my breath was a challenge. From up there the horizon seems to show the visible striations from the lower atmosphere to the upper stratosphere. The sky above even takes on a darker hue of blue.

It's corny but it does feel like the top of the world.
