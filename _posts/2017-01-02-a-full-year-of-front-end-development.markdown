For over a month I've been knee-deep in my AngularJS app. I expected to be done a couple weeks ago and as I'd planned on writing this post after I'd finished the project, this article got pushed back. And I'm still not done with my Angular project. But hey, it's a new year and it's time to kick the tires and take this post for a spin.

## Front-end Development

2016 was my first full year as a Front-end Developer. I still have a tough time explaining what I do to non-technical family members so I just tell them I build websites. That's not inaccurate but it's too facile, of course. I manipulate data, bend it over my knee, and spank it till it behaves. Mostly I learn, learn learn. I take a break and then I learn some more. I liken front-end development to learning a language while the alphabet keeps changing.

## The Tools Of The Trade

One of the best tools I have is the Internet itself. I constantly navigate territory that is uncharted to me so I have to ask questions along the way. Knowing how to ask Google the right questions to get the answers I need is a skill in itself. Being able to quickly sort the answers is also important. Stack Overflow is where I land the most when I'm out searching for answers. I'm not only comparing answers but comparing the reputation of the devs that answer questions, differentiating answers based on upvoting, and finding related questions.

For the sake of specificity, here's a short list of some of the technologies I consistently work with:

    WordPress
    Drupal
    Sass
    jQuery
    Ionic
    Angular
    Creative Cloud
    PHP
    NPM

Another key skill is reading/writing documentation. As I've written about before, I find that a lot of the documentation written is esoteric in nature and it's just not easily intelligible to me. And this is assuming that the documentation is complete and edited for errors. It's not unlikely to find outdated or unmaintained material online. I often write my own documentation for myself in terms I understand, once I actually comprehend a technology.

## Building An App As A Microcosm For My Job

The process for building this app has been a pretty accurate microcosm for my time as Front-end Dev. Progress has been slowed by learning a new technology on the fly, with the demands of the app (scope of the project) adding unanticipated and increasing levels of complexity along the way. Anticipating all the challenges before beginning a project is the goal but I still struggle with this; I need to get under the hood and take a look at things before I really have a grasp of the likely demands. Experience has given me more insight into soothsaying the problems I can foresee but often times there are still hiccups: cross-browser compatibility issues; project dependency updates and snafus; missing documentation; client-provided assets incomplete, unformatted, and/or non-existent.

More importantly, I study and copy a lot of other peoples' code. I mean, A LOT. I test their code, their strategies, and I see what works. I hope and expect others are doing the same with my, albeit small, contributions. Equally important, I believe, is that I doggedly pursue solutions by hacking my way through a dense jungle of distraction and misdirection. I spend tons of time excluding and removing ideas from consideration. Yes, there are more ways than one to skin a cat but that cat may never be skinned unless you decide on a way and go with it. I think that's a life lesson right there, kids ;).

As in building this app, my first full year as a Front-end Dev is marked most strikingly by my appreciation for the committed devs of the industry. This is a field where information is freely given away. Questions are asked, answers are given. There is no barrier for entry other than curiosity (hard work and altruism are preferred, but not required). Anyone's success in tackling a problem is a larger success for us as a whole. Sunshine and rainbows.
