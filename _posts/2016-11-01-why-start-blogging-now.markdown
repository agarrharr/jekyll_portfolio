Do I really want to add to the din of opinions on the Internet? Not really. Yet having read buttloads of blogs and technology documentation I see real language hurdles in how ideas are conveyed and I think I can help. Technology should be accessible by all, right? It should make our lives easier, not harder.

As I become a better developer I repeatedly encounter that I actually understand processes and strategies better than I initially thought I did based on the language I interpreted. But when someone asks for a proof-of-concept (POC), for example, instead of just simple 'proof' I get lost. So, dispossessing the requisite nomenclature, I still feel left behind a lot.

There is a real language firewall in web development and I intend to breach it.

For those following along at home:

    butt·load
    ˈbətˌlōd/
    noun
    a large number or amount.

## What I'm Afraid Of

This is the first blog post I've ever written and I'm a little scared. What if judgy (sic) people evaluate me not only on my lack of esoteric terminology but also my grammatical errors and, above all else, my misuse of past participles?

In terms of technology, I really fear that what I put out there may be misinformed or misguide others. And there's that little thing that terrifies me -- the idea of being a fraud and getting exposed by 'real' developers. Of course, that's assuming one incredibly long odd; that anyone will actually read a plausibly error-prone work of mine.  

## My Opinions Aren't Set In Stone

Not to draw comparisons between myself and ol' Ben Franklin but I think he addresses my chief concerns best when he said, 

>"For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others".

More to the point is the truth that blogging appears to be more a cardinal quality of web development. Just as teaching others helps cement our own knowledge, chronicling and rubber-ducking (talking an idea out loud to inanimate object, such as a rubber duck) what I've learned and what I'm trying to learn helps fill in the gaps of my own knowledge. Therefore, this is another tool of the trade. One that helps tighten down the bolts and screws of new ideas in my very own head.

Sit back, kick your feet up. I promise to keep these short and sweet. Ain't nobody got time for glib novels.
