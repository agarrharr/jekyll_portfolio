 This is the first blog post I've ever written and I'm a little scared. What if I sound dumb or boring and then judgy (sic) people evaluate me not only on my lack of quality content but also my grammatical errors and, above all else, my misuse of past participles?

 I resisted joining the fray for years for the usual reasons. Why add to the cacophony of opinion-porn that exists on the web? Why would anyone want to read what I write? Do I really want to share my thoughts with the world? What if it sounds dumb or I'm just plain wrong about something?

Well, suck it up, I say to myself. I may just be denying our planet that essential quality it currently lacks (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).

Not to draw comparisons between myself and ol' Ben Franklin but I think he addresses my chief concerns best when he said, "For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others".

In terms of technology, I'm afraid that what I put out there may be misinformed or misguide others. And there's that little thing that really scares me -- the idea of being a fraud and getting exposed by 'real' developers. Of course, that's assuming one incredibly long odd; that anyone will actually read a plausibly error-prone work of mine.  

More to the point is the truth that blogging appears to be more a cardinal quality of web development. Just as teaching others helps cement our own knowledge, chronicling and rubber-ducking what I've learned and what I'm trying to learn helps fill in the gaps of my own knowledge. Therefore, this is another tool of the trade. One that helps tighten down the bolts and screws of new ideas in my very own head.

Sit back, kick your feet up. I promise to keep these short and sweet. Ain't nobody got time for glib novels.
