I have big goals. I don't set out to just learn how to do stuff. I want to MASTER it. Anytime I do something I've already done I want to do it better, faster, and more importantly -- more EFFICIENTLY. I want to spend as little time doing what I HAVE to do so I can spend more time doing what I WANT to do. I want use as little energy as possible.

This year I want to master JavaScript. Yeah, I know that's a lofty goal and mastering it in a year is hardly realistic. But I'm going to get better. A lot better.

## The Language

ECMAScript 2015. ES6. Harmony.

Whatever you call it, JavaScript rocks. I like the story of how it came to be, as a flawed language that initially wasn't taken seriously. I like how it's name is a marketing ploy to garner interest based on an already well known language. I like how it's as essential to every browser as HTML and CSS. And it's outgrown just the browser. It's a full-fledged software language now with seemingly infinite potential.

JavaScript frameworks are perplexingly abundant. So, on the upside, the amount of time it takes to get an idea off the ground appears to be consistently shrinking. The downside of that is that the choices for deciding what works best for your project's needs is consistently growing. While I have honed in on AngularJS (and I'm really happy with it, by the way) I expect to be primarily focused on plain ol' vanilla JavaScript.

## The Hurdle

With JavaScript, the hurdle for me has often been lacking a clear visualization of what's happening. There's a certain amount of abstraction involved in writing a callback function, in building an object constructor, or in writing a foreach loop. With JavaScript's browser siblings, on the hand, it's more straightforward. For example, with markup you see an element on the page. With styles there is a straight path to follow to identify how an element's color or other property is styled. Objects in an array, by comparison, live inside the black box, so to speak, on their own. Unless you console log the contents or add them to markup through a loop, you never see them. While this may be completely pedestrian to some, or most, it hasn't been for me. And that's what I intend to change in 2017.
