I just dipped my toes into some Angular 2, AKA Angular, a couple weeks ago. And wow, a lot has changed. The Angular name almost doesn't fit anymore seeing how unique it is compared to it's predecessor. Once you get into a bit though, you begin to connect the dots and see where it overlaps with AngularJS (the old Angular 1.x stuff).

## What's New?

What isn't new?!

The `$scope` object has gone bye-bye. Yeah, I know. `Directives` have virtually disappeared. They still exist but now they're `components`. Speaking of replacements, `controllers` have essentially been removed -- rather, their logic is in `services` now. So, yeah, `directives` are `components` and `controllers` are `services`.

Here's some more new stuff -- it's ALL modular. It's not necessary to link to an Angular version. Just add the packages you need via NPM. And setting up a new project is a cinch with the new, robust CLI.

With the latest version of Node, four commands get you off and running.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli

ng new my-app

cd my-app

ng serve --open
```

## There You Have It

It's a lot to take in so go on and marinate on that for a while. We're headed in a new direction now.

For the nerds, the Angular docs are right [here](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart){:target="_blank"}.
