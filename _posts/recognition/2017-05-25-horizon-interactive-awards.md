[Horizon Interactive Awards](https://horizoninteractiveawards.com/){:target="_blank"} were just announced for 2016 and my former dev team and I won big. It was Horizon's 15th season recognizing excellence in interactive and creative media.

## The Competition

Thousands of entries from all over the world are submitted each year for Horizon's volunteer panel of industry professionals to review. These pros come from backgrounds in media, graphic design, advertising, and marketing. From the sea of entries they choose the very best work and determine who gets awarded.

## The Awards

Speaking of which, one of the awards we won was a Silver in the Self Promotion/Portfolio category for [Build Your Snowman](https://buildyoursnowman.com){:target="_blank"}. It's an interactive game that served as my former agency's holiday card.

The big one though, was a Best in Category (Real Estate) award for [Mighty Small Homes](https://mightysmallhomes.com){:target="_blank"}. It's a site built for a tiny home builder based in Louisville, Kentucky. As the lead developer, it was one of the most fun projects I've worked on.

As I've said before, many thanks to my old squad at DBS > Interactive. They deserve all the attention. If you'd like to read more about them you can find it [here](https://dbswebsite.com){:target="_blank"}.
