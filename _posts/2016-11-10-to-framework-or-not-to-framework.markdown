 Do you use frameworks in front-end development? Of course you do! Or wait, do you?! Don't turn this back around on me, this is about you.

 The reason I ask is I've come late to this development party and there's 50 million frameworks to choose from. You can get a project Bootstrapped and boilerplated in minutes. jQuery is so ubiquitous it's practically synonymous with JavaScript (please don't hurt me to those of you I just wronged.) Bourbon will not only have you texting your ex in minutes but it's also great at saving you time reinventing the proverbial Sass mixin wheel.

 Exactly where do you draw the line in defining a framework anyway? Is WordPress not just a 'blogging' platform but also a framework? Drupal? Magento? Are libraries and frameworks all that different? Don't they both reduce the amount of code you write while adding extensibility and making you that much more powerful? What about libraries like GreenSock that have you making dynamite animations right out of the box? Don't I need this in my life??

 I read the documentation for these technologies and there's a general consensus that I'm wasting too much time building from scratch and my rivals are leaving me in their dusts. Since I mentioned rivals and they're all ahead of me there could potentially be different kinds of dust they're leaving me in so, I say dusts. Who says 'dusts' anyway?

 With this in mind, should I just strap on the boots to get my plate boiled so I can quit wasting all this time? Ironically, most sapiens that code tell me just the opposite. They tell me to learn the hard way, the old fashioned way, the vanilla way. Learn why and how things work so I will know why and how frameworks actually work. I'll learn how to better implement said frameworks and heaven forbid a CDN goes down and I have to survive in the wilderness without my security blanket framework -- at least then I can code my way back to civilization while living off twigs and berries.

 I love being explanatory and verbose so if you're keeping up, a CDN is a content delivery network, or a system of distributed servers. These servers contain the code you need so you don't have to weigh down your own site with extra files. It's a great way to add a library to a site via a simple link.
